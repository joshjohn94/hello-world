# hello-world
my first repo
My name is Josh John. I'm 24 years old and married to Moriah. I want to learn to code/program because I want to create. I'm looking at this much like art but since I am not particularly gifted in terms of music or artistic ability, I figured I'd use my aptitude for learning.
